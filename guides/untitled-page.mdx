title: "Setting Up Your Environment"
---

This is the first installment in a multi-part series on Roblox script development, focusing on proper environment configuration. Many developers currently use inefficient workflows (such as coding directly within executors). This guide establishes a professional development setup.

## Step 1: Executor Selection

A reliable executor is the foundation of script development. Paid executors generally offer superior stability and features for those with available budget. Independent research is recommended resources available at www.reddit.com/r/robloxhackers provide detailed comparisons and community feedback.

For this tutorial series, Volcano executor will be used as the primary example.

## Step 2: Code Editor Installation

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) serves as the recommended editor for this series due to its robust extension marketplace and accessibility for developers at all levels.

**Installation Process:**
1. Visit code.visualstudio.com
2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system
3. Execute the installer and follow on-screen instructions

## Step 3: VSCode Extension Configuration

Extensions transform VSCode into a specialized Roblox development environment. Access the Extensions panel via the square icon in the left sidebar and install the following:

**Roblox LSP For Exploit**
ID: Itchino.robloxlsp-for-exploit  
Source: marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Itchino.robloxlsp-for-exploit  
Functionality: IntelliSense, autocompletion, and syntax support for Roblox scripting

**Universal Exploit Executor**
ID: strawberrys.universal-exploit-executor  
Source: marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=strawberrys.universal-exploit-executor  
Functionality: Direct script execution from the editor interface

Complete the configuration steps outlined in each extension's documentation after installation.

## Step 4: Core Script Library

Maintain organized access to these essential tools in your executor's scripts directory:

**Hydroxide**  
Repository: github.com/Upbolt/Hydroxide  
Description: Advanced remote spy with constant and upvalue scanning capabilities. Note: Some executors experience compatibility issues. SimpleSpyV3 provides a reliable alternative.  

**SimpleSpyV3 (Lightweight Alternative)**  
Repository: github.com/infyiff/backup/blob/main/SimpleSpyV3/main.lua  
Description: Streamlined remote spy with broad executor compatibility.  

**Dex Explorer**  
Repository: github.com/infyiff/backup/blob/main/dex.lua  
This is the Infinite Yield version of Dex Explorer. There are many variants out there, but I prefer this one (Lazy Dex is also good). The choice isn't critical pick what works for you.

## Advanced Recommendations

**Version Control:** Git implementation is strongly advised for any substantive development project, enabling change tracking and collaborative workflows.

**Lua Bundlers:** For complex projects requiring multiple modules, bundlers optimize the development process.
